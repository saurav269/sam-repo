    <h1> b tag</h1>
    <p>
        The b HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's
             contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was 
             formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw 
             the text in boldface.
    </p>

    <h1>i tag : The Idiomatic Text element</h1>
    <p>
        The i HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for
         some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among 
         others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original 
         source of the i naming of this element.
    </p>

    <h1>u tag : The Unarticulated Annotation (Underline) element</h1>
    <p>
        The u HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way 
            that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple
             solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.
    </p>

    <h1> select tag : The HTML Select element</h1>
    <p>
        The select HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options.
        The select element has some unique attributes you can use to control it, such as
         multiple to specify whether multiple options can be selected, and size to specify how 
         many options should be shown at once. It also accepts most of the general form input 
         attributes such as required, disabled, autofocus, etc.
    </p>

    <h1>button tag</h1>
    <p>
        The button HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse,
        keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then
        performs a programmable action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.

        By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the user agent 
        runs on, but you can change buttons' appearance with CSS.
    </p>

    <h1>hr tag</h1>
    <p>
        The hr HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements:
         for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.
        Historically, this has been presented as a horizontal rule or line. While it may still be
         displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, this element is now defined in 
         semantic terms, rather than presentational terms, so if you wish to draw a horizontal line, you should 
         do so using appropriate CSS.
    </p>

    <h1>br tag</h1>
    <p>
        The br HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for
         writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.
        As you can see from the above example, a br element is included at each point where we 
        want the text to break. The text after the br begins again at the start of the next line of 
        the text block.
